# Prediction-Using-Supervised-ML
In this Project i Developed a supervised machine learning model to predict student marks
based on study hours. And also predicted the score of a student who studies for 9.25
hours. In this Project I have used Simple regression to achieve our goal and also
used important libraries like NumPy, Pandas for reading and describing data. Used
Matplotlib & Seaborn to plot regression that gives a better and clear
visualization for such data. Also used train_test_split function from scikit-learn to 
split a dataset into two subsets: one for training a machine learning model and the 
other for testing its performance. 
 With Train accuracy: 0.9484509249326872 and Test accuracy: 0.93676610433650
